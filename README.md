Simulation_Optimization_of_Inventory_Management


• Estimated over 100 months cost and profit with a 90% CI by simulating (S,s) inventory policy over 100 months

• Analyzed the main and interaction effect of critical factors such as the value of S, s, and cycle service level (CSL)

• Implemented simulation optimization to calculate maximum mean monthly profit such that CSL>95%
